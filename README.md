# Predicting Applicant Success 
For this challenge, I work as a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm. Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has asked me to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. In order to do this, I have decided to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business.
